# Student-Management-System-Dart-OOP-Concepts-
A Dart-based Student Management System demonstrating all four Object-Oriented Programming principles — Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism. Includes real-world concepts like static variables and subclass behavior for Regular and Scholarship students.
📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism — implemented using the Dart programming language.
The program simulates a Student Management System, where each student has personal details, marks, fee status, and department information.
Different student types (Regular and Scholarship) exhibit unique behaviors using polymorphism.


🧱 Features
🏫 Abstraction:
Uses an abstract class student with both abstract and concrete methods.
🧬 Inheritance:
Subclasses Regular and scholarship inherit common properties and methods from student.
🎭 Polymorphism:
Each subclass overrides the message() method with specific behavior.
🔒 Encapsulation:
Student data is managed safely using constructors and class-level fields.
⚙️ Static Variable:
College name (clg) is shared across all student objects.

💡 Concepts Used
Concept	Description
Abstraction	Abstract class defines structure with abstract and normal methods
Inheritance	Child classes extend the parent class
Polymorphism	Same method behaves differently in subclasses
Encapsulation	Data grouped and protected inside the class
Static	Common data shared among all objects
